        EMPLOYMENT OVERVIEW
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Mathematics Teacher | BFITS Thailand | April 2021 - May 2022
    </h3>
    <p>
        Timekeeping: As a teacher, I had to meet strict deadlines for grading and completing course objectives. This was especially challenging as we were operating under work from home. I had to juggle multiple grade levels alongside behind-the-scenes admin to keep my courses running smoothly.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Games Host (Customer Service)| City Mazes Islington | July 2018 – September 2019 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Teamwork: The team at the Islington branch was very small, so often we’d have to run shifts by ourselves, overcoming issues with customers and administering repairs with little backup. As such, we would keep in contact with each other, informing each other about mishaps, and quick repairs that needed revision,
    </p>
    <h3>
        Customer Team Member (Part-time) | The Co-operative Food | 2016 – July 2018
    </h3>
    <p>
        Problem-Solving: The self-service tills at our store are prone to malfunctioning, so I’m often running around fixing small problems for multiple customers at once. I have to keep a keen eye so I can spot what the issue is with minimal interaction, while still being polite and delivering good customer service.
Communication: As part of my job I had to often talk to customers and sort out any issues that popped up. During rush hour I could have been dealing with multiple customers at once and would have had to keep calm under pressure and try to sort out everybody’s issues as best I could.

    <h3>
        Cúntóir | Coláiste Lurgan | Summer 2015
    </h3>
    <p>
        Leadership: While working there I was in charge of a house of 10 boys my age at the time, and had to earn their respect. I worked towards this by being authentic and trying to build up a relationship with them. After a couple of days, I had built up their respect and could easily ensure they were following the rules while still being friendly.

        HOBBIES AND INTERESTS:
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am an avid video game player, and now I take interest in changing game design over time, shifts in tropes and practices in the industry. I enjoy analysing games as I play and thinking of ways to potentially implement different mechanics. I also play board and card games such as Magic The Gathering, which also give me insight into game design as well as player behaviours.
